# Lab Tasks
  In this lab you will learn how to log into your course specific account through ieng6. This is divided into three simple steps, installing Visual Studio Code, remotely connecting, and finally, testing out some commands to make sure everything is functioning properly.
  
## Part 1 - Installing Visual Studio Code
The first thing you're going to want to do is head on over to the Visual Studio website which is https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

Once you're there, your screen should look like the picture below.

After this, if you're on a computer running a Windows operating system, click the install button and you're good to go. If you're on any other OS such as Mac or Linux, click the drop down arrow next to the Windows Install button and options for your corresponding OS to install VScode should appear.

When the installation of VScode setup is done downloading, click on it and follow the setup instructions as prompted by the application to install the application. 
Once your installation is done, open VScode and it should look very similar to the picture below but with maybe a different color on the background.

And thats it, we're now done with installing VScode!

## Part 2 - Remotely Connecting
Before we begin with this step, were going to find the course specific account that you're trying to connect to. To get started with this step we're going to first head into https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php 

Once you're on this website, you're going to enter your username which should be the first part of your UCSD email. In the picture below we use the example email of johndoe@ucsd.edu. 
After entering your username, you'll have to enter your student ID number which begins with the letter A and is followed by a set of numbers, in the example below, John's student ID is A12345678.
